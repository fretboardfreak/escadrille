    Good morning world. I plan on relaxing a bit this weekend and I've started by having a coffee and watching the men's world curling game on TV.  Canada won by the way.

    Yesterday, I stopped by Long and McQuade's and purchased an 8 track digital recorder.  I have always wanted to be able to record jams and loops.  Now I can, so I'm going to spend some time laying with that this weekend to.
