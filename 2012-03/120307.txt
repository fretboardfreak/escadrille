    Brier 2012 Draw 12 and the TV featured game is a brotherly rivalry between Jamie Koe from NT and Keven Koe from AB.  Me, I'm watching from the games room at work again!

    So I've done some looking around and I think I want to go purchase a Tascam DP-008.  It's an 8 Channel recorder with the ability to record two inputs at a time.  It has autopunch recording and records in wav/mp4 directly to an SD card.  As a bonus it also has a couple of open air mics to allow recording of acoustic guitars and so forth.

    That said, before I allow myself to buy anything new I need to:

        #. Finish Moving: Sort, organize, and put stuff away.
        #. Get my Addresses sorted out with all the necessary organizations.
        #. Put another $500 into savings.

    For that last point about savings: I think it makes sense to start putting closer to $500 dollars into my savings account every payday.  I've noticed that if I wait until the end of the Month, I usually end up spending too much money and don't end up putting anything into savings.  That *has* to change!
