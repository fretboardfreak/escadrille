.. topic:: 0900

    I just got reminded via email that I am on call this weekend.  After all of the horror stories that I've heard from the other people who have had issues during their on call day, I'm only slightly worried...

    That said, I went to the "onCall Basics" page on our wiki and I found that it has all the troubleshooting and component briefs that I have been looking for since I worked on the Runner team.
