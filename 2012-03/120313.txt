    This morning is yet more evidence that daylight savings time is a pain in the backside.  Our Israeli counterparts have not switched to daylight savings time yet but we have and the result is that they are probably going to be an hour late for our morning meeting.

    I just received an email from Apryl about tomorrow being pi day and it have me a bit of an idea. With my website being dynamically generated by python via CGI I could write snippets of code for things like a "daily digit" where the digit for the day could be a digit of pi calculated by taking the date as a number and calculating that digit of pi.  For example today is 120313 so the digit of pi at that position would new today's digit.
