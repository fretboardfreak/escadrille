    I had a great curling weekend!  Between Thurs. and Sunday I curled a total of 6 games and we only lost one.  The Friday night mixed league game was cancelled for the Telus Installers Bonspiel that we played in.  Our first game was very close but we ended up losing in the last end to skips rocks.  That was the only game of all 6 that we lost though.  Overall, our team won the B event and received as prizes our entry fees plus 5 dollars each.  All in all, a success!

    Add to that, that I received pretty much nothing while I was on call and thus did not have to ditch my team to go to work!
