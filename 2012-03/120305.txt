    This weekend was just one disaster after another.

    It started on Saturday when I decided to go shopping.  It started out just fine, I went to the Superstore and spent a good hour and a half loading my cart.  When I got to the checkout I realized that I didn't have my wallet with me.  I looked around for an employee but as is usual for workplaces filled with minimum wage, under-educated, middle-aged employees, there were none to be found.  Instead I took the meat and frozen items back to the shelf and then hid my cart in the clothing section before I went home to grab my wallet.  When I got back to the Superstore 5 minutes later somebody had taken my cart so I had to spend another hour and a half trying to fill it again from memory this time.

    I'm sure that I've forgotten something but I'm not quite sure what it is yet...

    The second shitty thing that happened this weekend happened on Sunday.  I wanted to make a nice big meal that I could use for leftovers and stuff, so I put together some nice rosemary stuffed chicken breasts and roasted potatos.  It looked great, and it was gonna taste great, but when I went to put it in the oven, I found out that my oven won't even warm up.  I tried everything I could think of to try and get the oven to work, but to no avail.  I'm going ta have to call the Maintenance people to come look at it sometime today or tomorrow.

    The Brier has started now!  I just tried to open the live online stream but it turns out that TSN.ca won't let American IP addresses watch the live streams so I'm down in the lunch room watching curling on TV.  Tonight, Zakk is going to come over and bring my TV so we can chill and watch the game tonight too.

    I just found out that the pool room also has a TV.  For this afternoon's game I think I will try and sit in there because there should be fewer people to come in and interrupt me than in the lunchroom.  Especially since this afternoon's game starts at 12:30pm MST.
