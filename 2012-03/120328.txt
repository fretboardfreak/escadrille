    I get to go see the Blue Man Group tonight with Chris Pederson, but first I have to make it through another day of work.

    That may be harder than it should seem too.  My Co-workers are unit test crazy and they insist that I write many highly coupled tests so that if anybody decides to change something at a later date they have to do 5 to 10 times the amount of work that it should be.  These tests are so tightly coupled that even if you change the names of a variable or two, you'll probably have to also change some unit tests so it will all work again.

    I think I should find a good book about the SCSI protocol.  A fair number of our dev meetings with Isreal involve discussion about the SCSI protocol and I'm fairly lost through a good chunk of those conversations.

    I should also bump up my study time of the distributed systems textbook that I am reading.

    Another goal I should resurrect is the CGI blog website that I have been working on.  I think I have all the necessary pieces, I just need to put it all together.
