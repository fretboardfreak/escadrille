    This was a busy weekend.  Between Saturday and Sunday we: went to the boat show, ate pho at phobulous, watched 3 episodes of the UK TV show Sherlock Holmes, ate at the Flamingo Lounge, purchased a couch and armchair, bought a bunch of things for my apartment at Wallmart, and won the GUSL cup for the second year in a row.

    All in all it was a decent weekend despite how tired I feel.

    Woot!  I have a couch and an armchair now!

    This morning when I sent the email out to let everybody know that I would have to leave a bit earlier than normal to be home for a couch delivery I made the mistake of using the word 'sofa' in my email.  A number of people thought I was referring to our 'Sofia' delivery (the codename for the next releaes of our product).  Needless to say I made a number of people do a double take at me email that said I had a delivery for that today.
