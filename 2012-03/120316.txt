    Mom has landed. Unfortunately I forgot to get my second set of keys from Nicole the other day so I had to give Mom mine. Apparently there is a boat show at Northlands this weekend and Mom wants to try and make the trek to go and see it.  All I can say is that I hope she doesn't get lost and end up in Saskatoon or something.

    For some reason the IO Generator application that I have been fighting with has the *feature* to write *over the edge* of the volume I give it.  Meaning if I tell it to write to only the first 2 million blocks out out of a 2.1 million block device, it should write to somewhere between 2.0 and 2.1 million blocks.  It is mind bogglinglgy silly.

    PyCon!  Last weekend there was a Python Conference and today we get to sit in the board room and watch some of the talks.  The first one is all about imports in python.
