    Monday's.  Who needs em?  Wouldn't you rather just sleep through Monday's?  I would like that at first.  Soon, though, I think Tuesdays would turn into the hated day and we'd all want Monday back again...  Now I'm torn.

    This past weekend was my last for the season.  It was club playdowns weekend for the Granite and our mixed team (Chris E., Sherry, myself, and Nicole) achieved third place in the Friday Mixed league this year and we managed to get the same place in playdowns.

    On Friday night we played our first game against Gartner.  It was a very close game but in the extra end with Chris's last rock we ended up missing the important shot and losing.  Being a double knockout we then played three games on Saturday.  Each of those were great games.  The first two games on Saturday ended in 4 ends each and our last game on Saturday ended after the 6th end.

    On Sunday though, for the B Event Final we ended up playing Gartner again, and losing again.  There is a little bit of solace in this fact though because the Gartner rink went on to beat Jesse Johnson's team twice in a row to win the whole thing.

    It is a relief to be able to say that the only team we lost to were the winners, but at the same time I really wanted to win a jacket and a birth to the Cities. In short I was dissapointed in our Sunday morning showing.  Not the ideal way to end a season.
