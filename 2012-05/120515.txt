    Good morning world. It appears that I tend to go a few days where I write some stuff and then there are days where I don't end up writing anything.

    Last time I wrote something it wad just before the van Halen concert I think.  Well the tickets never showed up in the mall so it was a good thing that I arranged replacement tickets for us.  The show was SO good!  David is still a crazy monster behind the Mic and the Van Halen family are as good as ever.  Eddie lived up to the hype that a 30 year career creates.
