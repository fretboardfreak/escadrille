    Good morning world.  Last weekend went by very quickly. I had the tires changed on my car and on Saturday we had the spring thaw at the granite.  The thaw was good except that I don't have photo ID because they take your license when you change your address.

    On the weekend I also went to Brewsters for a beer and their seasonal beer right now is Espresso Porter. It was extremely tasty, and I may have to make a stop this afternoon.
