    Good morning world.  I have finally checked in my big Consistency Checking change set for Chimera's IOManager!  Yay me. (*thunderous, audience applause*)

    Yesterday after work I finally went and tried the pool at my apartment complex.  It's not very big and I don't think it's heated because it's lukewarm.  That said, it felt great for my shoulder and I felt really good afterwards.  Today my back is a bit stiff -- almost as if I went swimming yesterday or something -- but despite that my shoulder and neck feels a bit looser than normal.  I think if I maintain my stretching and start swimming a couple times a week, my shoulder will be back into good shape in no time. I have my fingers crossed.

    Van Halen tickets should be coming in the mail any day now.  Hopefully they arrive today or tomorrow otherwise I'm going to have to call ticketmaster and see what can be done about it.  The show is on Friday and I'm very excited to see them. But I don't have the tickets yet and that makes me nervous.
