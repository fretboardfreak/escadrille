    Good morning world.  It's been a while since I've written much. I guess I've been so focussed on work and other things at home that I didn't leave myself much time for writing.

    I think I may have agravated the tendons in my left arm or something because my wrist has been very sore this week.  My shoulder hasn't gotten a whole lot better even though it hasn't gotten worse.  I should probably go see that physio person my mother found last time she was here but I'm not sure I'll have time until June to do so.

    TGIF! Boy am I glad that today is Friday.  My brain is fried, the week felt like a month, and I'm looking forward to the weekend!

    Tomorrow night is the Spring Thaw at the Granite.  That should be fun.  Chris invited us for beers at his place to pregame and I've invited Zack. It should be a blast.
