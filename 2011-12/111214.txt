    Guess who's coming to town?  well, duh, Santa will be coming too but what I meant to say was that I'm coming to town.  Q-town that is.  This week has been a bit crazier than usual for just that reason.  I have been doing all my normal things this week but I've also been working at Christmas shopping and packing for my flight.

    Also another big thing that happened recently was that Nicole and I recently celebrated our 2nd year anniversary.  Yay for us.
