Originally the idea was to provide automation around the python based
``pelican`` website generator tool. Now it is the system that keeps my website
running.

Written mostly for python 3, squadron is a system of python packages and
binaries that can be composed to create various custom websites.

Squadron:
    A flock of pelicans.
