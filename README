Originally the idea was to provide automation around the python based
``pelican`` website generator tool. Now it is the system that keeps my website
running.

Written mostly for python 3, squadron is a system of python packages and
binaries that can be composed to create various custom websites.

Squadron:
    A flock of pelicans.


Design Notes
============

``preprocess.py``
-----------------

Searches for the list of preprocessing tasks available in the python packages,
reads a given config file and executes the preprocessing tasks. Examples of
some useful preprocessor tasks:

- copy files from different places into one build directory
- generate meta content files from data such as the log of a git repository,
  system logs, or practically anything you can think of.
