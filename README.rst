Escadrille:
    A French term for a small wing of air force fighter planes, or small
    squadron.

    An automated system that performs a set of tasks to create publishable
    output.

Written in python 3, escadrille is a system of python modules that can be
composed via an INI format configuration file to create various custom
websites. Escadrille operates by performing tasks that are specified within the
configuration file. Some tasks perform very basic operations like making
directories or copying files around. Other tasks perform higher level
operations such as generating RST source pages from various source content (git
repository log, directories of images, etc.).

*Backstory:* Originally the idea was to provide automation around the python
based ``pelican`` website generator tool. At the time the clever name that the
project was given was "squadron" because a squadron is a term for a group of
pelicans. The name was already in use though so the project was renamed to
"Escadrille" which is the French term for a small wing of military fighter
planes, or small squadron. Now the Escadrille project has grown into the system
that keeps my website running.
