Well, it's official. I'm a horrible blogger. It has been 4 months since my last
confession... I mean entry... and boy have I sinned... or something.

Lots has changed since the last blog entry that I wrote.  The biggest change of
course is that I am now single.  That was a long time coming though.  It's
weird, I don't register the ending of my relationship with Nicole as such a bad
thing.  Completely the opposite of how it was when Erin and I broke up.  Nicole
and I are amiable, friends even; we still curl together just fine.

AHHH!!!! The curling season is coming to a close... and I don't know what I'm
going to do with myself when curling is over.  :(

Despite my freak out, this week has been super full of curling.  The Brier is
in town so I've been out to the bar a bunch to watch as many games as I can.

Chris Evernden and myself got free tickets to the first draw of the Brier
because we played a shuffleboard game this year called 'Cool Shots'. Cool Shots
was the brainchild of the CCA; they donated curling style shuffleboards to 4
curling clubs around town.  Each of those clubs had to run a couple of
tournaments to choose a winning team for the club, and those winners were then
invited to the opening draw and to play in the Brier Patch Cool Shots
tournament.  We got pretty lucky because we won for our club but in the first
end in the tournament at the brier we (read: Chris) gave up 6 points. The games
were only 4 ends so we did not manage to come back after that.

As well, I took yesterday off of work because I scored some tickets to the
Thursday morning games.  Zach joined me for the game in the morning but he had
to work part of the day so he took off instead of going to the patch afterward.

This week also marks the start of playdowns for most curling leagues.  This
year our Friday Mixed team is the grand aggregate league winners and our GUSL
team is second place in the A pool.  Hopefully we do well in the playdowns!
