Well, it's official. I'm a horrible blogger. It has been 4 months since my last
confession... I mean entry... and boy have I sinned... or something.

Seriously though, lots has changed since the last blog entry that I wrote.  The
biggest change of course is that I am now single.  That was a long time coming
though.  It's weird, I don't register the ending of my relationship with Nicole
as such a bad thing.  Completely the opposite of how it was when Erin and I
broke up.  Nicole and I are amiable, friends even; we still curl together just
fine.

AHHH!!!! The curling season is coming to a close... and I don't know what I'm
going to do with myself when curling is over.  :(

Despite my freak out, this week has been super full of curling.  The Brier is
in town so I've been out to the bar a bunch to watch as many games as I can.

Chris Evernden and myself got free tickets to the first draw of the Brier
because we played a shuffleboard game this year called 'Cool Shots'. Cool Shots
was the brainchild of the CCA; they donated curling style shuffleboards to 4
curling clubs around town.  Each of those clubs had to run a couple of
tournaments to choose a winning team for the club, and those winners were then
invited to the opening draw and to play in the Brier Patch Cool Shots
tournament.  We got pretty lucky because we won for our club but in the first
end in the tournament at the brier we (read: Chris) gave up 6 points. The games
were only 4 ends so we did not manage to come back after that.

As well, I took yesterday off of work because I scored some tickets to the
Thursday morning games.  Zach joined me for the game in the morning but he had
to work part of the day so he took off instead of going to the patch afterward.

This week also marks the start of playdowns for most curling leagues.  This
year our Friday Mixed team is the grand aggregate league winners and our GUSL
team is second place in the A pool.  Hopefully we do well in the playdowns!

It seems our Friday mixed team had saved all of our bad luck for yesterday's
game.  Oh boy did we lose.  Even the fluky shots that we made were better for
the other team than for us.  At one point, Sherry raised their rock from
half-way gaurd, through a hole that you couldn't draw through (angles were
wonky) and onto the button, behind lots of gaurds.  I'm just glad that playdowns haven't started yet.

Club Playdowns are the weekend of the 22-24 of this month.  The weekend after
next. There isn't any curling next week either.

With no curling next week, that means I'm free to change days that Jordan and I
have our guitar lessons.  An additional silver lining for me is that since
Jordan wants to switch to Thursdays, I get a few extra days to work on the
lesson plan.

I do not think that I am yet at a point where I am free to take on additional
guitar students.  It seems there's barely enough time in the week to get all my
chores done, go to work, have some me time, *and* create brand new lessons
weekly. Although I'm tempted to reduce the me time, I've learned in the past
that I can't maintain a level of focus like that for long.  So instead I'll
stick with one guitar student for now.
