    Good Monday Morning to you.  Zach started work at EMC today.  April paraded him around to meet everybody earlier and now he's down on 2nd floor trying to watch the training videos from the wiki.

    I've been thinking about the inclusion of pictures in my blog and on the rest of my website and I'm thinking that it would fit my use-cases better if I split the blog out on it's own.  That way the blog pictures don't add to the size of my notes directory by too much.  I noticed that with even just 10 or 15 pictures in the directory, synchronization times between PC and phone increases quite a bit.

    That means, my four directories are:
    - config
    - code
    - fret
	- blog

    To prevent three need to further split things up, my website is going to have a way to keep some directories more confidential than others.
