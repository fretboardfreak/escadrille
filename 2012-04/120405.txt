    What a nasty way to wake up. Between the time that I went to bed last night and the time that I woke up this morning almost 6 inches of snow had fallen.  Yuk!

    I had to go out for lunch today because I did not have any leftovers left this morning.  Unfortunately that meant tramping through all the crappy white stuff that fell last night and is melting now.  I completely soaked my legs below my knees because of the slush and being splashed by passing cars. As a result, I am working from home this afternoon.
