    Happy Easter World! This morning I am both relaxed and amazed, yet again.  I woke up early enough to catch the last two thirds of the *Canada vs. Scotland* game at the Mens World Curling Championships.  Logically that means that I am amazed at the ability and the difficulty of the shots that they are making. I'm having coffee with Bailey's on the Saturday morning of Easter long weekend, that pretty much covers the relaxed bit.

    Yesterday was a bit of a whirlwind. A slow, controlled whirlwind, if you will. And, even though I got a number of things completed, yesterday, I still have a bunch of things on my list to do.  C'est la vie. I completed:

    - two loads of laundry
    - dishes
    - made cookies
    - changed strings and did intonation/check up on my electric guitar

    Now, I also spent a fair time lounging and drinking spiked coffee or tea and playing video games or watching a movie so it was also a good day yesterday.

    For dinner tomorrow night I've been invited to Nicole's Auntie's house for Easter dinner.  So, tonight I want to make a big roast or tenderloin on the bbq so that I can have some leftovers for the week.  In order to do that I have to go shopping to fill up my fridge.  I guess that will fill up part of my day then.  Over the rest of the day I want to work on unpacking and settling things in.

    For instance, I want to organize the TV stand and re-arrange the furniture between the living room and spare bedroom.  I've done some thinking and I believe I have a vague idea of what I'd like to do with everything.  When I get it arranged I'll post pictures.

    Okay, our guys over in Basel, Switzerland are playing the *11th end, tied 6-6* with Scotland in the *1-2 Page Playoff Game*.  The only silver lining is that Glen Howard and team are coming home tied with hammer.  As long as they can shake off the miss that Glen had in the 10th end that made them play the 11th, and regain their concentration then they should be all right.  They have been controlling most of the game so far but both sides have been making some crazy shots!

    *I feel a bit like Vic or Russ doing this...*  Rink (Team) Howard of Canada has come through and won the chance to win another world title for Canada.  He made a simple draw to the four foot against a Scotland rock buried in the top 8 foot.  What a good game!

    The Semi-Final game will be on at 2pm EST so I will be again on the couch at 12pm MST to watch it! My pot of coffee is finished, the game is over, and golf is now on tv so I'm going to go have a shower and play some guitar. Since I'll be watching the game all afternoon I won't be left with much time to do a big roast.  After the game this afternoon I think I'll go shopping and pick up stuff to do that meal, but I'll wait and do it on monday.  I can do a steak and potato and something tonight and I'll make sure to get some desert!

    Yet again I'm watching curling. This time though I have the volume down because I'm gonna try dictating to my phone using the voice recognition software and then re-edit everything later. So if there are any typos, that's why.

    so far so good although I'll have to see how deficient editing process is
