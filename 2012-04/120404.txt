.. topic:: 0730

    Good morning world; mine sure is today.  I am sitting in my housecoat watching the Men's World Curling Championships.  I mentioned in my post the other day that I might get a chance to watch a game on TV before the weekend.

    Time to go shower during a commercial break.

    Shower is done and tea is made.  It's 5-4 for Canada against Sweden in the 7th end.

    My tea this morning is a strongly steeped Toasted Walnut Green tea with a teaspoon of raw sugar. Yum!

    Oh goody, work.  *Don't worry, I have a few minutes while I wait for my system to load.*

    I stopped at Starbucks on my way into work today.  I'm kinda digging having the choice on my way in to work of which coffee shop I buy my morning coffee at.  So today's coffee is a Venti (*whats with the confusing names for sizes?*) Medium  Roast.

    There's really nothing like some good music (Paul Gilbert right now) and a good coffee to help you tackle tough problems.

    Whelp, I finally got my act together and set up my eeepc a bit more.  I'm now running a nicely configured LXDE with WICD as my wireless manager.  There are still a few things to work out but I will work on those as I feel like.
