.. topic:: 0800

    It's Monday morning, it's raining, and I'm working.  I think I'd rather be at home right now.

    I had a good weekend. On Saturday, Craig, and Kassi had a potluck BBQ, so I made a big bowl of potato salad.

    In the potato salad I substituted Dijon mustard for half of the frenches yellow mustard and it tasted great!  I highly recommend it!

    The BBQ was good, and so was the food.  We had Burgars and various forms of salads and deserts, as is typical for a potluck.  While the sun was up we sat outside, played with the dogs and played a game of Bocce Balls.  There were plans to have a fire but we didn't get around to it.  When the sun went down, it started to get a bit chilly so we went inside and played drinking games.  At some point in the night the PS3 got turned on with some Karaoke game (*Singstar* or some such game).

    *Continuing the BBQ story.*

    Eventually, when people started dropping out of the party - sometime around 3 in the morning - I walked home.  From Craig's place to my new place only took about 25 minutes top walk since it's only about twenty blocks or so.  The walk was great because there are streetlamps the whole way and the weather was very clear and warm.

    All in all, it was a good way to spend Saturday night and Sunday morning.

    Zach and Justin Bogner just left.  We were at my place drinking beer on the deck because the NFS went down at work today.  Actually, the network was apparently having issues all morning.  I didn't notice, of course, because I have a local home directory set up so the spgear auto-mounts don't make my laptop unuseable when it's off the spgear network.  The NFS went down at around noon though, so after lunch we played pool and ping pong until we decided to give up and go home.  Instead of home though, Kurt, Justin, Zach and myself decided to go to Vinny's pub (by my place).  We had a couple of drinks there and then Kurt decided to leave so the three of is just came to my place to raid my beer fridge.

    That was my afternoon.  Well, that and the awesome sun! The weather is *awesome* today. Spring is finally here.  That means I have to get my tires changed.
