    Oops, I lost track of time watching top gear.  I'm gonna regret this in the morning.

    I stayed a bit late at work today because I'm trying to finish this IOManager change-set for RecoverPoint consistency checking.  I've had a couple of false starts and is really grating on me that it's taking this long.

    A UPS guy just dropped off a small package for me from the Alexander Kieth's brewery.  It was a pack of four coasters that my parents decided to send my way when they won them with a case of beer.
