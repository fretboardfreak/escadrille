    Woah, this morning went by very quickly.  I came in at my usual time and went straight to work.  It's a good thing I made lots of progress so far today because it really sucks when time flies and you're doing nothing.

    We're heading for lunch to Tropika in a bit because Rachel Chung is leaving the company.  Last week was Vera's farewell week.  Attrition is still affecting us despite the number of new hires we have on our budget this year.
