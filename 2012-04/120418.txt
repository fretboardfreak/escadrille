    Today brings another exciting day at the office.  I think it's almost about time for me to take a good vacation!

    Yesterday was Zach's birthday so a bunch of us went over to Uncle Glens for pizza and beer.  Not only was it worth it, but I have pizza sitting in the car waiting to be eaten for lunch.
