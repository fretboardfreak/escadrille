    Good morning Monday.  The sky is clear and the sun is out, yet I'm stuck inside until 1500-1600.  Bummer!

    I had a good weekend.  I made some progress on recording my first song with my new `Tascam dp-008 <http://tascam.com/product/dp-008/>`_.

    The new Tascam unit is pretty nice to work with.  So far I have only played with multitrack recording.  I'm almost to the point with my first song though that I should try to master the tracks.  From what I read in the manual, I should be able to master the 8 tracks to the master stereo track and then continue to edit the 8 tracks.  At any point in time you can re-master whatever you have recorded so it would make sense to do so periodically.

    Oops, I just realized that I put this post under April 2013.  That would have been confusing a year from now.

    On the weekend I had to go out and pick up some rechargeable batteries for my digital recorder.  Yes, batteries instead of AC power because there is simply less hum due to AC power interference when you use batteries.

    While I was at Futureshop though, I picked up two other items that may or may not be of interest.  The first -- not very surprising but it was a good deal -- was a 32Gb microSDHC card for my phone.  The second -- and more interesting purchase -- was guitar strings.

    I had heard that Futureshop had entered into the instrument selling business but I figured it would be more like the Source's idea of selling instruments, "If we can sell all these shitty electronics to people maybe we can sell other shitty stuff too!".  It isn't that bad.  It's not all just Nova guitars and Casio keyboards; they actually have some real instruments in the entry level to mid ranges.  I believe I saw some Yamaha, Kramer and a few other guitar brands there.

    To be honest I was impressed more with the fact that the Futureshop at South Ed. Common can stock more gear than poor Heath can at Quesnel Music back home. I'll still be heading to Long & McQuade instead of Futureshop for any and all of my main purchases but it was kinda nice to also pick up some guitar strings while I was picking up batteries and a memory card.

    Oh, by the way, having a 32Gb memory card in my phone is very nice.  I used to have a 16Gb card so it's not that much different but I can haul around a bit more music and a few more pictures this way.

    Waiting at the mall for lunch. I had to go to the bank to deposit my security deposit from my old apartment so I stopped for lunch at the same time.

    I've been thinking a bit about what I want to do with the music that I record with my new recorder.  It would be neat to see how much it would cost to have CDs and jewel cases professionally printed up.  If I can print 100 CDs for less than six or seven dollars a piece then I would only need to sell 60 to make a profit.  The question is whether or not I can sell enough CDs to make it a worthwhile.

    I should ask Gautam how many he has sold and through what mechanisms he sold them through.
