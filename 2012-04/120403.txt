.. topic:: 0800

    Good morning world.  For some reason I woke up this morning just before my alarm clock rang.  It's almost as if my circadian rhythym is starting to wake me up earlier and put me to sleep earlier.  For the past week and a bit I've also been falling to sleep closer to around 11pm than my usual 1pm.

.. topic:: 0830

    Just making some *coffee perg* for our morning meeting.  (I'll have to check the spelling for that tea)  I hope the meeting will be happening at the scheduled time again.

.. topic:: 0835

    It looks like Isreal has changed their clocks now because the meeting is back on it's 0830 scheduled time.

    Yes, I know I'm writing on my phone instead of participating in the meeting but I normally am just here to observe anyways.  The main reason I attend this meeting is so that I can be aware of issues before they come down the line.

    I started a new notebook at work the other day.  It's not hard to appreciate a clean, blank slate to take notes on again.

    Too bad the Mens World Curling Championships are in such a different time zone than ours.  The games are on the ice at 0300, 0800 and 1300 Eastern Standard time (+2 hours from Mountain Standard time).  Ugh!  And the games aren't being televised the same way they are during the Brier.  Only 6 of the round robin games will be televised between March 31 and April 5.

    I'm planning on watching the game tomorrow morning before coming in to work.  If it starts at 0800ET then that means it starts at 0600MT for me.  I should be able to watch the game and then come in a bit late for work.
