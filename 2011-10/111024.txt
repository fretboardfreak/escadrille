.. topic:: 2230 - Watching Star Trek with the girlfriend

    I've decided that if I'm going to start to use Swype for my writing on my phone, I should start to embrace it's quirks and learn to make out work for me. When I really get going with it I canfill a good portion of the page in less time than I can on my old phone and even faster than my tablet.

    Nicole and I are just watching a quick episode of Star Trek while we eat our oodle noodle.  Them it's time for bed.  Good night.
