.. topic:: 09:30 - Yay Curling

    Wow. It is a little hard right now to figure out where the week has gone.
    After working on my VM Server last weekend I sort of buried myself under
    non-techy things for the week.

    There were even a number of days this week where I didn't turn on my
    second computer. Instead of sitting in front of a PC all week I have been
    curling, reading and working.

    I started reading a few Tom Clancy books again.  Say what you will about
    the depth of his stories; I find them to be highly engaging when you're in
    the right mood.

    As for Curling, I am registered in 3 different leagues this year.  The
    Sunday evening GUSL (Granite University Sunday League),  the Friday night
    mixed and the Thursday night mens.  We lost two people from our GUSL team
    of last year so we've picked up Chris Pederson from school and Ellen, a
    lady Nicole has curled with before.  The Friday night team also lost two
    from their lineup of last year which allowed Nicole and myself to fill
    those spots.  Finally, my thursday evening team has been a team of three
    for the past couple of years.  Shinya (spelling?) played with them last
    year and they wanted to continue to get more and more competitive.

    It looks like I'm going to have another great year curling!

.. topic:: 15:00 - A Days Work Lost

    Well, that's why you should focus on tiny tiny tiny commits and then
    squash them into one atomic commit and merge your project branch back in.

    It's the only sane way to work in git.

    Now I know that's a big statement to make but I stand behind it.  I just
    lost a considerable amount of work because of a typo in a script. The
    result was removing a file with modifications before I could even stage
    it.  What a waste.

    From now on I should foster a stricter habit of saving the file, then
    committing it to the repository.  At least that way it's double protected
    against stupidity.
