.. topic:: 800 - bright and early

	Good morning world.  I am at work, bright and early as usual. This morning I also put my winter tires in the car too, because my car had a doctors appointment.

	So far I think I like typing my notes on my phone and it has been nice having a full copy of my repository available on my phone too.  The only thing I might think about changing up would be some of the note formats that I've used.  Some of them tend to be difficult to match with a phones keyboard.

.. topic:: 830 - meeting room blues

	I'm not a fan of meeting series with no location.  Every week it seems like I dial in to a meeting with no room just to find out I can walk across the hall and join the group in a conference room.  Annoying

.. topic:: 1530 - car doctors waiting room

	That's right. I'm spending part of my afternoon sitting in the waiting room of my cars doctor.  That's right my cart had a doctor.  Put more accurately my car has a dealership that performs simulate functions on cars that doctors do for humans.  Either way I'm sitting in a waiting room with nothing to do but play on my phone.

	I've already killed a good chunk of battery playing games.  I think my phone should be fine playing games for a couple more hours but it's alarming to see a full fifth of my battery had been used since I unplugged my phone this morning.

.. topic:: 1730 - home again

	I'm home again.
