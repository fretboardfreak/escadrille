Lost a Day, Gained a Server VM

.. topic:: 10:00 - Server VM == Great Idea

    I spent a great deal of time yesterday configuring my new debian server
    virtual machine and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed so far.  By
    setting up the server using bridged networking I'm essentially gaining a
    new server class machine without any hardware.  The best part is that I am
    able to run the VM on any computer that is currently running.

    The major driver for this move to a VM server was my need to have a server
    setup at home but never really having a stable PC setup to use.  There are
    multiple reasons that I have a *need* to have a home server, namely:

    - Need a privately hosted git repo
    - Need external access point for my network
    - Proper incremental backups
    - Website things that I'm unable to do at curtissand.com

    Now that I have the server set up, running and pretty much ready to go
    there are a number of scripts and features that I want to add.  It would
    be nice to have an interface for submitting patches (for when ssh git
    pushes are unavailable).  Also a script triggering interface would be good
    to have too.

.. topic:: 11:00 - Looking at Ditz for Todo/Bug/Issue Tracking

    I've spent the morning reading about issue tracking systems and I am
    starting to think that the *ditz* project could come in very handy.  I've
    already seen what happens if I just start working on a whole bunch of
    scripts.  It isn't pretty.  Hopefully with ditz I'll be able to keep track
    of the things that I'm working on and use it more like a todo program
    than anything else.  I'll have more on this later.

.. topic:: 23:50 - Idea About the Python GIL

    I was just reading this article about the `Python GIL and Threading
    Implications
    <http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html>`_
    and it strikes me; everybody is fixated on removing the GIL so that
    multithreaded applications will work better.  I propose that we try adding
    global level interpreter namespaces and multiple GILs. Of course we'd have
    to test out the memory usage effects this would have but essentially it
    could allow multiple threads to request an interpereter resource.  Typical
    systems today have more than enough ram to run a limited number of python
    interpreters.
