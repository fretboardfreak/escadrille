19. New Phone On The Way
========================

.. topic:: 0800 - Morning Time

    So yesterday I ordered a new phone.  Now I can't wait for it to come in.
    I bough it from expansys.ca which means they will ship it from Virginia.
    Anyways, it's bright (suns just coming up) and early on a Tuesday morning
    so I have to go to work.  Cheers.
