Winter is here.  Curling is in full swing, and it is snowing.  Actually it's
snowing a butload. Over the past few days we've probably gotten about 1-2 feet
of snow.  Not bad for the first snowfall of the year. As usual, Edmonton's road
crews are woefully inept and not up to the task.  I'm not sure how many
kilometers of road are in Edmonton and area but there are only ~73 or so pieces
of equipment on the roads (according to a news report I heard on the radio).
