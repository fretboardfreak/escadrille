I got bored and this is what happened.

A random picture of my workbook and my tea.  I was bored and stuck in a
meeting, so this happened.

7:30am and I'm watching Canada beat Sweden at the Mens World Curling Championships in Basel.

*It's Toasted Walnut Green Tea by the way!*

This was what I got to wake up to on the 5th.  Between 11pm the night before and 12pm that day it snowed about 8 inches.  Three days later it was all gone.

    :alt: My home work station. Comfy!

For the same day of the big snow storm, I had planned to eat lunch at High Voltage.  Even though I wore my winter boots the snow was so deep, and the cars were sending spray so far that all three of us got soaked.  I had the best footware so I was in front and ended up soaking my pants and shoes right through to my socks.

Needless to say I worked the rest of Thursday afternoon at home.  What a way to start the long weekend.

I finally got around to putting my entertainment system together.  This time around I tried to be as minimalistic and clean as possible.  Most of the top of the unit (behind the TV) is bare.

After doing the entertainment system and pushing it back into the corner, I found that I needed to pull the armchair closer to the TV.  This left a few feet behind the armchair that looked weird and empty.  So, I decided to bring the little desk out of the spare bedroom.

    :alt: Can I drive your couch?

I moved the black drawer unit to the other side of the couch and moved the couch closer to the window.  This makes it better for every seat to see the TV, and the drawer unit is more accessible by the thermostat.

Thats it for now, check back later in the month.
