    It is a Tuesday. In this part if the country that usually means that I get to do this fun thing called a job.  A job is a daily obligation to do things for somebody elsp e and in return they give you the means to live.  One has to work until one can afford to finish out ones life without financial help (unless you have kids with good jobs).

    Since I don't have kids with great paying jobs yet, I'll just have to settle with working 260 days a year until I do.

    It's interesting how well one can track the progress of teammates when using SCRUM by only listening to the daily progress reports.
