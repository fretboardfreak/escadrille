Even Coffee Can't Help Today
============================

.. topic:: 11:20

    Yeah, I said it. I, FretBoardFreak, the coffee crazed fanatic just admitted
    that coffee has failed to make me feel better this morning.

    I don't know what the issue is. I finally slept properly last night. I even
    slept in my own bed rather than the couch. Yet, despite all my efforts, my
    entire right shoulder/back/neck area is tensed up with muscle knots and I
    practically have a migrain.

    So, no more coffee today because it makes migraines worse. No, today I'm
    resigned to hot showers, ibuprofin, decaff tea and water and a couple of
    really thourough stretching sessions. Hopefully I can shake this.

Really Liking This Blog Format
==============================

.. topic:: 11:30

    I think I've decided on the format that I want to stick with for my blog
    entries. That said I may decide to change it later on. We'll see.

Another Shower, and More Ibuprofin
==================================

.. topic:: 12:30

    It is now officially afternoon. It's a Sunday though so I don't care.
    Finally, I get to take another round of Ibuprofin for my neck and
    shoulders. After doing my drugs I am going to take another piping hot
    shower because the last one helped my muscles.

    Then I get to go to Nicole's place this afternoon. We'll be installing
    Ubuntu 11.04 on her laptop today. Exciting. Maybe while we do that I'll
    start working on my website management scripts today.

Great Afternoon/Evening
=======================

.. topic:: 21:30

    I had a pretty good afternoon and evening over at Nicole's place today.
    We installed Ubuntu 11.04 on both of her laptops and played with her new
    hampster, Peanut. She even made dinner for everybody. Nicole's sister
    had a couple of friends over and the three of them were dealing with last
    night's consequences :D

    I'm at home now, listening to Dream Theater's newest album *A Dramatic
    Turn of Events*. It will be their first album since they lost their long
    term drumer, Mike Portnoy. I really like the album; it gets back to the
    roots of what Dream Theater's albums used to sound like.

    I'm going to take a break from the computer now, top up my tea, and go
    play guitar.
