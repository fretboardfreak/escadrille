.. topic:: 11:00 - Coffee and a Keyboard

    I have the two things I need to keep me occupied for the afternoon.  Well,
    that and Zorgempire.  My plan for the morning is to work on a staging
    system for my website, while at the same time playing Zorg.

    For the staging system, I want to have a "live" site and a "staged" site.
    I will probably also be adding a copy of the last "live" site so you can
    revert your changes if something bad happened. I'm not sure how I'm going
    to do this quite yet though.  I won't be working on the design here
    though, because I'll start a project page for those details.

.. topic:: 11:40 - So Much for Programming

    Just poured the last cup of coffee from the pot.  I also just started
    Dream Theater's *Scenes from a Memory* album.  It is quite a good album
    with songs ranging from acoustic guitar to straight up metal in weird
    times.

    As for my original plan of programming and playing zorg...  Well it sort
    of turned into just playing zorg.  Which is just fine by me for this
    morning.  My Zorg Speed account is doing great ever since I stepped down
    as Admiral of Hellenia.  I'm still Vice Admiral but the day to day details
    of running the alliance are no longer on my shoulders.  It gives me the
    freedom to actually play zorg and improve my empire but it also gives me
    some time too keep up with things like member tracking and forum
    maintenance.

    That said, if I write in this blog instead of actually playing zorg then
    my plans will change again and I'll be forced to write *another* blog
    entry.

.. topic:: 19:00 - Coded the Day Away

    Well after my last entry I played zorg for a good long while.
    Technically, I still am playing, just not as actively as I did until about
    1pm.  Then I got talking to tora and he asked how the member tracking was
    going.  That prompted me to start programming a script to parse the
    alliance page and generate a nice report.  I ended up programming away the
    entire afternoon.  The result is a pretty sweet, rst style table and no
    further progress on my website.

    I guess we have to take the good with the bad.  I'm off to order pizza and
    find a movie to watch whilst eating said zah.
