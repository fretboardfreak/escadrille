1230: A changeset of Epic Proportions
=====================================

I'm just sitting here at work waiting away the lunch hour so I thought I'd
write a short post here.  I took over a big changeset and review from Marc and
so I am waiting for the rest of the team to get back so I can finish.  The
reason I'm getting antsy to finish this little project is twofold:

#. The whole repo is on *freeze* until this changeset is in.
#. I'm leaving work at 2pm, leaving me 1 hour or so to finish this review and
   get this changeset checked in.

I have to say though, that this changeset is the largest that I've ever worked
on.  If everything goes well I will be checking in a changeset that has 14K
added lines of text and a total of 20K changed lines (added, deleted or
modified).  Essentially it is a *changeset of epic proportions*.

The reason I'm leaving early is because it's a long weekend. :D  Zach,
Michelle, Nicole and myself are taking a road trip back to Quesnel for the
weekend.  It should be fun; I've been looking forward to it for a while now
too.

We'll be taking Raven (Zach and Michelle's puppy) half way to Hinton too so
that will be exciting.  We'll be leaving Raven in Hinton at Zach's parent's
place because my Mom is allergic.

So long for now (until my next post).
