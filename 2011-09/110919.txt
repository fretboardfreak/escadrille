.. topic:: 17:00 - WFH was Great

    I worked from home today and it was great! I like working from home
    because I get fewer distractions from whatever I'm working on. With the
    VPN setup that they have at work and the *WinBlows* XP virtual machine I
    have on my laptop, I have full access to my work email and instant
    messaging systems as well as our git and webservers to boot.  That means I
    do my work exactly the same way as I do in the office I just have fewer
    distractions around me.

    Everything went good today.  I slept well, but not long enough.  I
    managed a fair amount of progress on my projects too.

    It was all going great until about 4:30pm when I stood up to go get
    something.  I must have tweaked something because I had an instant
    headache and my shoulder muscles started aching again.

    Since I haven't had one yet today and since it helped yesterday when I did
    the same, I am going to go for a piping hot shower and a dose of
    ibuprofin.  Maybe that will relax some of the muscles and ease some of my
    pain.
