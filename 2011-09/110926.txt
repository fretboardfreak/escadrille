.. topic:: 18:00 - I finally have a moment to relax.

    Yep. I do. Admittedly, it is a little hard to actually put everything out
    of my head today but distracting myself with games and music seems to be
    working so far.  I have a hard deadline coming on Wednesady and I have a
    hundred things I need to get organized.

    Thats all I'm going to write about work in my blog tonight because I'm
    going to put that out of my head for the evening.  The plan is to go to
    bed early so I can get an early start in the morning.  Until bedtime
    though, the plan is to surround myself in a work free zone.

    ... I just went to play a wee bit of Zorg and either my browser froze or
    Zorg is down.  :(  I'm gonna go play with that now.  Ta-ta
