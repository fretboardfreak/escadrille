.. topic:: 8:40 - Sunny Morning, Fresh Coffee

    For some reason I didn't write a post for yesterday and the day before.
    It's not that I didn't have anything to write, I just didn't get around to
    it.

    Yesterday, I went to the electronics store across the highway from EMC and
    after asking around, I was able to find a mini-HDMI adapter for my tablet.
    It was very exciting because I've been looking for one since I bought the
    tablet.

    I was quite impressed when I got home yesterday and tried it out.  When
    the HDMI adapter is plugged into the tablet the screen turns off and
    everything is instead sent to the TV.  However, the touchscreen is still
    on and it acts just like a little touchpad on a laptop.

    I might even go so far as to say that you could have a pretty neat mobile
    setup with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse and an android with mini-HDMI
    out. Some of the new mobile phones are more powerful than the big ol'
    clunky computer I have at home. The fact that they have multicore cell
    phones now blows my mind.  It probably shouldn't, but it does.

    It's one thing talking about Moore's law at school and watching the chip
    giants talk about how small their processes are (innuendo intended).  It's
    another thing all together to see multicore chips, so advanced that
    they're smaller, lighter, more efficient and more powerful than all the
    chips of the previous generation.  Mind == Blown.

.. topic:: 10:00 - Just Received a Temporary Job Re-Assignment

    I just got word from Hardik that I have been chosen to jump ship and move
    to the Recover Point Scrum team.  It sounds like this will be a *High
    Visibility* project and most of the team members are the people that I
    worked with last summer on the AOL project.

    I currently don't know anything about what Recover Point is other than the
    fact that they need both myself and Rachel Wong for the next 5 months or
    so to write automated tests for them.

    The bad thing about that is that I will no longer be able to stay on top
    of the code reviews for the audit system.  I won't be able to work on an
    rst python API library - at least not at work - or the sqlite back end for
    the Audit System. In fact I have been asked to summarize my back log so it
    can be passed off to whoever is going to take over my projects on the
    Chimera team.

    I predict that nobody will step-up and design the database back end for
    the audit system though so I'll probably have a chance next year to work
    on one.

.. topic:: 14:15 - Too much Excitement, Too little Sleep

    I just poured myself a cup of tea and put on my sweatshirt.  My usual
    morning *pep* has been all used up already so I need to rely on liquid
    karma (read: caffeine) for the rest of the day.

    Unfortunatly the lovely little muscle knot in my neck still hasn't gone
    away.  So that's a great addition to my afternoon.  I think my only
    salvation will be to *wire in* and program until the day's over.
