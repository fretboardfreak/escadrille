So Much To Do, So Little Motivation

Coffee == Liquid Karma

.. topic:: 10:00

    Though it may already be 10am, I feel more like It's 6am.  For some reason my
    shoulders aren't feeling that much better today, despite sleeping in my own
    bed.

    It feels like I have such a list of things I want to do:

    .. note::
        Many of these items have idea pages with them.  I should link to those
        pages that do exist.  Also for items that need a more in depth
        description I should make a page.

        - misc cleaning/tidying/organizing
        - laundry
        - dishes
        - upgrade Nicole's laptop
        - grocery shopping
        - wash the car
        - get an oil change
        - program a CGI based site-mgmt ui
        - program a CGI based todo list
        - improve site aesthetics
        - re-arrange landing page for a beta *go live*
        - re-evaluate pswd protection scheme on site
        - re-write bash profile scripts
        - look into multi-category todo extension for sphinx

    *In fact*, this is such a good list I'll update my `ToDo List <../index>`
    right now.

    Wow, that's a lot of stuff that I really want to work on soon.  Some of the
    stuff at the top will definitely get done once I get going today.  The rest of
    this though will need to be fleshed out more and turned into a project.

    ...

    I just had an idea.  My site right now has a section where I put my ideas, a
    section where I put my various notes for future reference, and a locked
    section that will be able to store some of my more sensitive data.

    I think I should add a section called projects.  When an idea becomes a
    project, the idea would be moved into an archive directory and a new project
    page would be created.  Obviously the new project page should link to the idea
    that it stemmed from.

    The project pages would be the perfect place to keep my notes about various
    projects.  I'll be able to make multiple design documents if I need to for the
    project too, by simply making the project a directory rather than a single
    file.

Okay, Enough Chatting
=====================

.. topic:: 10:20

    Okay I think I've done enough figurative jaw flapping for this morning.  I'm
    going to sit back, relax, enjoy my coffee, play some video games and wait for
    Nicole to awaken.  Then I'll be able to start the day with an envigorating
    shower and start tackling my ToDo list.
