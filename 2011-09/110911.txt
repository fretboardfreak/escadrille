I have spent the weekend watching data dance.  Yes, that's just fancy way of
saying that I got some new hard drives for my NAS [#nas]_ and I've been stuck
babysitting data transfers through a USB2.0 adapter... Yuk!

I just had an idea for updating the notes on my website!  I could add a few
clauses to the file upload cgi script that I finished earlier.  I then add an
option to my notes script which makes a tarball named prv_notes.tar.gz.  If I
get really ambitious then the script can also use urllib2 to post the file to
the webserver.  Until I get that gung-ho though I'll start with manual upload
of the tarball.

The server side script would then untar the package and replace the website
contents on ``curtissand.com/prv/``

.. [#nas] Network Attached Storage.  Similar to an external hard drive but
    accessible through the internet.  This is the one I have: `Dlink DNS-323
