1020: Back to Work after a Long Weekend
=======================================

Alas, the long weekend is over.  :(

I do, however, have to say that it was a great weekend... for the most part.
On Friday, I left work early to pack and then we picked up Zach and Michelle
and Raven.  Then the 5 of us hit the road towards BC.

At Hinton, we dropped Raven off with Zach's Mom and then went to L&W for
*crack pizza*.  After pizza we continued on to Quesnel.  I think we got to
Quesnel around 2:30am Alberta time.

Saturday was spent out on the lake.  We towed the island [#island]_ out with
the paddle boat and anchored it with a couple of down-rigger balls. It was
extremely relaxing!

On Sunday we went for a drive around Quesnel.  The drive included going around
the lake, out around the Pinnacles loop (out the Nazko Highway), and out to
the oval and go kart track.

Finally, we drove back to Edmonton on Monday morning.  All in all, it was a
great trip.

.. [#island] The *island* is a large inflatable float for lounging on the
    lake.  It can easily seat 8 people or more and a cooler too boot.
