Today has been a productive day. I've been working from home today and that
means no distractions.  I managed to get a few code reviews finished -- I'm
taking a break in the middle of one right now -- and now I'm going to
prototype a release notes generating script.

The Release Notes Generator uses the last git tag matching
"``ChimeraV\d.\d\d.\d.\d``" to the current HEAD of origin/dev to generate a log
file.  It then displays each log message to the user and gives the user a menu
of choices for what section of the release notes that it should be added to.

I'll use subprocess to run the git commands, the ``re`` module to
find and match/sort the tag strings, the ``cmd`` module to provide
the command line interface to the user, and a bunch of string and file IO
operations to put all of the messages into a nice rst format and sorted
into their proper sections.

Wish me luck.
