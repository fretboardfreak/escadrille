New Blog Format
===============

.. topic:: 6:20

    I'm testing a new blog format today.  I figure that blog posts should tend
    to be smaller entries on my website.  Coming to this decision was only
    easy when I realized that longer posts usually end up being
    ``../../ideas/index.txt`` papers, ``../../ref/index.txt``
    papers, and work documents so a simplified format for blog entries makes
    things cleaner.

Python 2.7 on dusty (a.k.a. csand-alpha)
========================================

.. topic:: 6:30

    I think I should be able to install a python 2.7 interpreter on dusty.
    This way I won't have to upgrade the OS on dusty right now.  My only real
    motivation for wanting to upgrade to 11.04 is python 2.7 because I've
    started writing my own scripts in 2.7.  They are no longer backwards
    compatible.

    This upgrade should tide me over until I buy a new media server machine.
    I'm very excited for that, but it might be pushed off until after I buy a
    new phone.  I haven't yet been able to decide which one is more valuable
    to me.
