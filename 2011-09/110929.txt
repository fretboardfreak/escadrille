.. topic:: 8:45 - Replication, Splitting, Etc.

    This morning, and likely most of today, I'll be reading, watching videos
    and hopefully learning something about RecoverPoint.  It seems like a
    pretty interesting feature to be adding to VPlex.

    Last night, I found out that `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/>`_
    has a bunch of very clear explanations about what the various EMC products
    are.

    | `EMC Corp. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC_Corporation>`_
    | 'VPlex <http;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPLEX>`_
    | 'RecoverPoint <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RecoverPoint>`_
    | `Invista <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC_Invista>`_

.. topic:: 14:00 - File Conversion Fun

    I have been tasked with writing a conversion script to convert between
    Excel and markdown files.  I'm not entirely sure yet on the specifics but
    it sounds like it should be a good project.
