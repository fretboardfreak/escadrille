.. topic:: 8:40 - Rudely Kicked out of Shoppers

    Yeah, you read that title properly.  This morning, I got rudely kicked out
    of Shoppers Drug Mart.  It was 7:56am when I walked into the shoppers on
    Calgary Trail and 80th Ave.  The door was open, the lights were on and as
    far as I knew, Shoppers is a 24Hrs/day sort of joint.  Well, I guess I was
    wrong because this little cashier lady ran over, talking a mile a minute
    and shoo'd me out of the store.

    To put the figurative topping on the cacke, as I walked out the door she
    rather rudely said to me, "We're not open until 8 O'clock, pleas come
    back."  All I was able to do was look at the time, shake my head and drive
    away.

    So that is how my pre-work morning went.  Lets hope things get better as
    the day goes on.

.. topic:: 9:30 - Vacation Time

    I just looked into the vacation time policies with EMC because my parents
    have been asking about my Christmas plans already.  It appears that,
    although I am supposed to receive 10 days of vacation per year, it
    accumulates uber slow. So far, I have 24 (and some ridiculous fraction)
    hours of vacation time accrued.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen you read that
    right.  I have *24.something* hours of vacation.

    And the icing on that particularly bland, substance-less cake?  By the
    time I finish my second Quarter as a full-time employee I will have
    accrued 46 *hours* of vacation time.
