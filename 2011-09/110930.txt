.. topic:: 9:15 - Exploring a New Distro

    Don't tell Ubuntu but...  I'm cheating on him!

    Yeah, thats right.  I'm trying out the debian operating system in a
    virtual environment for now.  I'm looking for an alternative to the Ubuntu
    system because I am very close to switching.  Lately, the Ubuntu community
    has started making changes in a direction that diverges from my needs and
    wants.

    Ubuntu want's to create an OS that can rival Apple's OSs or Microsoft's
    OSs.  The result is a number of design desicions that have opted for
    form over function.  I know that they make a Server release that is better
    suited to my needs, but I have noticed that the Ubuntu Server mirrors the
    changes that happen in the desktop release.  This usually means that when
    they change something big like the window manager (*Unity == the-suck*)
    the server release will also receive that change eventually in a later
    release.  Quite simply, that isn't something that I want to deal with.

    Now, to be fair, the Ubuntu Dev Team has done an unparalleled job at
    improving many of the useability headaches and negative social stigmas
    that linux has typically suffered from.  They have significantly increased
    the linux's market share for desktop type use.  Only recently have their
    release to release changes started to rub me the wrong way.  As time goes
    on, it gets harder and harder to create and maintain a heavily modified
    Ubuntu installation.

    Since Ubuntu is based on debian I figured that it would be a good,
    familiar place to start.
