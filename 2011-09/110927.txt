.. topic:: 8:30 - The Silent Alarm

    Unfortunately I slept through the first hour of my alarm this morning.  It
    was set to go off at 5:30am but I don't remember seeing or hearing it
    until 6:30am.  Nicole on the other hand, did hear it go off.

    Thats really too bad because now I am getting the same start as I do
    everyday instead of an early and extra productive one.

.. topic:: 14:00 - Pleasantly Surprised

    Since my last post, I worked pretty much straight (even through lunch)
    until not long ago. I was trying to:

        a. finish coding an enhancement
        b. clean up the code and the docstrings
        c. multiple test/fix cycles
        d. final tweaking of the output format

    Yesterday, I expected all those tasks to take most of today.  That's also
    why I had set my alarm so early.  I wanted to come in to the office and
    get a head start because I fully expected that I would be staying late
    today. Those are only about 2/3 of my total list.

    Now though, as you can see, I can see that my fears were mostly unfounded.
    I have ten or so minutes to take a quick break and then I get to go do
    some more testing.

    The reason I have all these things to do before tomorrow is because I am
    switching teams temporarily.  Thus, as of tomorrow I belong 100% to the
    Recover Point team instead of the Automation team. I'm excited to learn
    about this new area of the product but having to pass off all of my
    current projects and workload is harder than it would seem.  I am
    dissappointed that I won't be able to keep up the code reviews for the
    audit system that I wrote or implement the enhancements that I've been
    designing into our release script.

    I guess that's life though.
