.. topic:: 0830

    I see that I've forgotten to keep writing updates again last week.  I really am trying to get into the habit of writing short small posts to keep my personal log up to date etcetera.  I probably won't post all of my log to the public internet because it has a lot of personal stuff in it.  The main purpose for writing this is so that in a few years I can look back and see what was happening, what kind of person I was and so forth.

    It appears that I only miss log updates when there is a lot going on in my life.  Between my last post (12/02/21 or last Tuesday) and today I looked at apartments, put a deposit on one, moved into it (about 90% complete so far) and organized to get out of my old lease.  How is that for progress!

    My new place is quite a bit farther south than I've ever lived in Edmonton.  It's down at 11144-28Ave, which is about a block away from the Century Park LRT station now.  It seems like a very nice little neighborhood.  There is a park just accross the road with a bit of a hill that I want to try tobogganing down too.  Looking on google maps, there is a couple of close pub/bars as well as a pharmacy and a Safeway that is really close.

    The company that runs the apartment complex is called `Boardwalk <www.bwalk.com>`_ and it looks like they are super organized and have everything figured out.  Craig, from my Thursday mens league team, has told me that Boardwalk operates over 30K apartments accross Canada.  If that is true, you can't really argue with the numbers - they have a good thing going.
