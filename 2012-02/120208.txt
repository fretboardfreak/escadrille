    It looks like Nicole and I are goin on a road trip this weekend.  The plan is to curl on Friday night and then drive down to Airdrie that night for a short visit with Nicole's Aunt and Uncle.  Then on Saturday we'll drive the rest of the way to Medicine Hat for Eric's party.  Hopefully I don't get carried away and can drive the whole way home on Sunday because we really need to continue winning our GUSL games if we want our names on the trophy again.

    My shoulders are killing me tonight.  I guess over the last few days I have lapsed in my stretching schedule a few times and I'm really feeling it now.  This tells me that I still have shoulder and back muscles that are out of whack more than I thought.

    Mom has sent me a couple of docters (GP) to call, because we both agree that I need to see somebody who can do an evaluation of what treatment that I need for my back.  The problem is that her first two pick for doctors were in Mill Woods which is about 20 minutes away.  How long do people normally drive for their first choice of doctor?

    Also I will need to ask someone about my orthotics sometime down the road. I wonder if not wearing proper orthotics enough has contributed.  My current orthotics are old and may have degraded to a point of negative usefulness.  Although I did notice a positive difference when I wore my orhotics in my curling shoes.
