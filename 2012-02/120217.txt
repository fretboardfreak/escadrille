    73 Days until my lease is up!

    Last night, as I was about to turn of the lights and fall asleep I started hearing the door buzzer ringing in the apartment above me.  It kept ringing and ringing and ringing, then every once in a while I could hear the chick that lives upstairs yelling at the front door. Normally I would just ignore it all and fall asleep, but then she decided that she needed to buzz my apartment too. After the second time she buzzed my apartment I told her to quiet down and go away from my sliding glass door.  As expected, she swore some rude obnoxious thing and continued to buzz and yell and generally be a nuisance.  It took about an hour before the idiot upstairs woke up and let her in.  Some might think, "Great she's in the apartment, this story is gonna end." but then you would be wrong, because the two of them then decided that the best course of action to deal with the situation would be to yell at each other (right above my bedroom I might add) for another hour or more.

    Eventually I got to sleep, but that was a respite too short to be thankful for.  I was, yet again, rudely woken this morning by that idiot Jense that lives below me.  For some reason he decided it would be a good idea to wake up at five in the morning and start banging on my floor.  After about 25 minutes of banging I heard the water run for a little bit and then he turned his music on nice and loud so I couldn't get back to sleep.

    I have been informed that Jense has been served his eviction notice.  That is great news to hear, because he is a danger to both himself and everybody around him.  The news, however sweet, is a bit on the side of too little, too late though because I will *not* be renewing my lease at this apartment.  Even if it means that my rent will go up a bit then so be it. Considering everything that I've dealt with since moving in, I'm frankly surprised that I'm still living there after 3 years.

    Here's to hoping that I find a nice apartment for next year.
