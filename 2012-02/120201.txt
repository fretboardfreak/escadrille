.. topic:: 0830

    Wow, yesterday went by so fast that I barely took the time to write anything.  The `ESS <http://ess.ualberta.ca/>`_ Career Fair went pretty well.  I spoke to a ton of students, gave out a bunch of USB keys and Beverage Cozies and we even collected a good number of resumes. After the fair Nicole and I went to The Pint for food before I took her to curling.  I decided not to throw rocks yesterday because my shoulder has been pretty tight from all the curling last weekend.

    I have spent most of today either in meetings or prepping the collected resumes from the career fair.  It feels very unproductive.
