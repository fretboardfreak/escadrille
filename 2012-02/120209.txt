    So much to do but so little time left to do it.  We leave tomorrow after curling and before then I have so much to do before we go.

    First things first, Eric needs a gift. I was thinking of getting him a decent bottle of aged rum if I can find some. Then the car needs some attention. I need to check the oil, windshield washer fluid, and the tire pressure before our drive. Then I need to pack.  We should take pretty much everything we need including towels, washclothes and the like.

    There is a group of people who need to do some testing with our system.  The problem is that we need our system to do our work.  Reasonably, we've agreed to trade systems for a day so that they can do their testing and we can continue to do our work.  As expected though, they - for whatever reason - have thus far neglected to send us the info about our replacement system.
