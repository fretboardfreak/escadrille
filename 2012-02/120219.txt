    *Im writing this before bed after the 18th*

    Today has been yet another series of experiences that show how little safety my possesions and I actually have in this apartment.

    It started this morning when I looked out onto my deck and found a bunch of broken glass, an empty cologne bottle, and an empty butane cylinder.  They look to have been thrown up there over the night.  I swept everything into a Safeway bag and and showed Bill before I threw it out.

    What am I really going to do about it at this point? I'm sure that it was Jense again but what sort of real proof do I have that it was him?  I only have circumstantial evidence, I guess a cop might say.  Ocassionally I hear him yell something like,'that f*^#ing a$$hole upstairs *mumble mumble*' and he is always banging on the roof (my floor).

    This morning I went out to my car and there was a massive broken loaf of bread strewn all over my car.  I quickly brushed it off and left on my way.

    Up to his point I have simply been trying to ignore the things he does, short of notifying Bill when a new burn shows up on my door, or when something in the building gets broken.

    Later I came home and parked out front so I could keep an eye on my car over the day.  That was a mistake.  If I can see my car, so can Jense and he is a little off balance so you never know what he might do.

    I got to doing chores and keeping busy for a good while but my productivity slowed right down when Jense came home.  He started banging super loud on my floor every time I made a sound loud enough that he could hear. I have no idea what his problem is; I didn't even challenge with a bang on the floor this time because I'm afraid of what he might escalate this to.

    This is not a drill people.  I am in full commando mode and being super quiet with everything. When I next looked out the front window to my car though, there was one of the metal bar constructs that go in Jense's windows leaning against the front of my car.

    *I fell asleep so I am continuing the story in the morning now.*

    So the window bars were leaning against my car.  It didn't look like they were hurting anything so I left them there.  I went and again told Bill about the bars and he told me he wanted to call the cops on Jense for dismantalling the building or something.  He also asked for me to leave the bars there in case the cops wanna see them.  I'm slightly skeptical that they'll do much of anything but I agreed to leave the bars for a while.

    I continued to finish the loads of laundry that I had on the go, during which Jense did a lot of yelling and banging on my floor.

    The next time I glance out at my car, perhaps around 8 or 9 PM, I see the bars sitting on my windshield but I can't tell if anything else has happened.

    When I go out to my car I see what looks like a milkshake or something has been dumped over the windshield and windows.  Thinking quick I took the bars down to Bill's workshop so that he had them, then drove my car about two blocks away and parked it.  My reasoning here is, if Jense knows that its my car he might do something to it. So if I park it a block away he probably won't know it is my car.  After parking a couple blocks away I pulled out my flashlight to do a better insection of my car and I can see that the milkshake actually looks more like puke covering the entire roof.

    The other thing I learned from yesterday's encounters was that I can't leave any of my things outside anymore, and that includes my car whenever possible.

    I have no idea why this guy is so angry.  I also have no clue why he would target it at me other than my being his upstairs neighbor.  The only conflict we have had is that he occasionally makes massive amounts of noise, during which I might bang a couple of times so he can hear it (read: very loudly) and/or turn up my own music a bit to drown out his gangster rap.  I have never yelled or spoken in any agressive manner with the guy.  The few times we did speak were cordial enough, at least that's what I thought.

    I have an appointment to see a couple of places for thursday and I should keep looking to see if I can find any other prospective places too.  I'm aiming to get possession of a place for April 1 so that I can get out of here as early as reasonable.

    Here's to hoping that it doesn't get cold enough that I need to plug my car in at night.  I'm heading to get grub, shower and then go clean my car today.

    Well I went and washed my car.  Luckily it wasn't even frozen (uber yuk by the way) so the automatic car wash took good care of it.

    After the car was clean I went for a drive through a bunch of areas like mill woods and riverbend and such.  I'm really looking for potential places to rent for this year but I am also keeping my eyes out for areas that I could later buy in.

    There are a good number of residential areas, both old and new, southwest of work that I could see myself living in.

    Now though I am installing debian on my computers, drinking tea, finishing the last load of laundry and dishes and just having a relaxing day. I have parked my car a couple blocks away and have taken the chairs off my deck in the hopes that there won't be any more incidents or damage before I move out.

    So long for the ridiculous hope of having a quiet day at home.  I went and put a load of laundry in the washing machine and then I was sitting in the living room reading a book when I smelled something burning.  Using my sniffer I followed the smell to the front door.  Just before I could get close enough to the door to get a look through the peep hole there was a quick knock.  When I did look, there was nothing.  I heard footsteps on the stairs and the door to Jense's apartment and then all went quiet.

    Touching the door handle, I could feel that it was pretty warm.  I left it for a few moments just in case and then when I carefully opened it I saw the word "RAT" on my door, spelled out with burned paint.  This time though he also torched the door knob and the door jam.

    I'm not sure why I didn't think of this the first bunch of times that he burned things in my door, but I finally moved my fire extinguisher right onto the counter by the door just in case I need it.

    This has me seriously consisdering renting a storage area for a month and just bumming in with Nicole and her sister until I get possesion of a new place to live.  I really need to get out of here, for both my physical safety and for my mental safety and stress.

    I'm going to spend the rest of tonight and this weekend packing things up. If I decide to get out of here ASAP then I need to be ready.
