    I was a scatterbrain yesterday! I left the office early so that I could meet the Shaw guy who set up my cable and internet.  Then I went to Zakks place to pick up a bunch of my stuff (except for my TV).  While I was at Zakks place I must have taken my phone out and then placed it somewhere because it turns out that I left my phone behind.  I then went to my old place and got a load of things to take to my new apartment.

    It wasn't until I left my old apartment that I realized that I didn't have my phone on me.  At that point, I damn near panicked.
