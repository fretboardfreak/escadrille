    This morning is going a bit on the slow side.  I have three untested changesets to test, Rachel has a massive changeset to test and Dave has a test to do but we all want the same system.  It is at this point when it would be extremely nice to have multiple CLR setups so we don't have to wait in line to test.

    Two hours and change left in the day.  I am really hoping that I can test out some of my changesets before the end of the day.  It would be nice to be able to post my changesets for review tonight.
