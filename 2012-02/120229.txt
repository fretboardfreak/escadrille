    *Continuing my story from yesterday morning...*

    After checking all my pockets for my phone I rushed back to my old apartment hoping that I had left it there somewhere.  To my dismay, no phone.  So I drove over to Nicole's place hoping that she'd be able to call me and somebody would answer.  When I asked her to call me though she tells me that I had left my phone at Zakks and he would bring it to me the next day.

    The reason Zakk was able to bring my phone to me the next day was because he had an interview with Victor, for the runner maintenance position. According to Victor his interview went well.

    I am at this bar called Vinny's.  Last week Craig and Kurt talked about this place as the good local bar.  After work today I finally got around to going for a quick drive through the neighborhood.  Well, low and behold I found Vinny's and I just had to come in for a bite.

    My first impressions of the place are pretty good.  It is attached to an Italian pasta restaurant, so I'm hoping that the food is good.

    The bison burger is pretty good.
