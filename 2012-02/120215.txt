    What a week.  As usual, I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut-off trying to get things done.  And - again, as usual - it doesn't feel like I've accomplished very much.

    This weekend was great.  Eric was very surprised to see me down there.

    On Friday night Nicole and I drove down to Airdrie after our curling game.  We got there at about 1230am.  Then on Saturday drovethe last 3.5 hours to Medecine Hat.  Saturday night was the party and then we droveall the way back to Edmonton on Sunday.

    Everything went great.  I even had a chance to visit with Mitch and Robin (Eric's friends from Tumbler Ridge).
