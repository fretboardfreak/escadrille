    Ugh.  It's Monday and I'm dog tired.  I need to get into some better sleep habits.

    I am trying to figure out a way to make it to Eric's 25th B-Day party down in the Hat. The only issue that I have is that I really don't want to have to miss curling on Friday evening.  I was thinking that I could drive to Calgary and crash with family there after our game on Friday.  The problem with that is timing.  We curl at 7 so we get off the ice around 9.  Say we leave right after the game - give or take about 30 minutes - then we get into Calgary at 12:30am.  I guess it's not too bad but the next morning I need to wake up and drive the rest of the way to Medicine Hat.  Hopefully Nicole will come with me to keep me awake.
