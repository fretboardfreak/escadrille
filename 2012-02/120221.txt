    So I got the heck out of dodge this weekend. I spent Sunday night at Zack and Michelles place and then on Monday morning Zack and I went back to my apartment and packed up as many of my expensive or irreplacable things.  It took us two trips but we got a good bunch of my stuff out of my old apartment.  At least now, if Jense ends up burning the building down, I'm out, the main part of my stuff is out and insurance will cover the rest.  Today, I start calling a bunch of places to see if I can't find an apartment for rent on March 1.

    Well, at lunch time I went and looked at a couple of places and put a deposit on one of them.  I have to go into the leasing office again today after work to drop off a proof of employment letter to help with there background check process.  Before I go back that direction though I will be going to the Post Office and putting a "hold" on my mail until the 10th or something and then I have a couple of things to pick up at my old apartment.
