    I want to start being less sporadic about my blog entries.  That isn't the only thing I want to work on this year though.  I also want to learn how to invest in the stock market, I want to learn about mortgages, I want to live a cleaner life (more daily housework), I want to play more guitar with Craig and zakk again and I want to start aqcuiring electronics equipment.
