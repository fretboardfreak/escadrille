    Good morning world.  Today I woke up with a stiff shoulder again.  For some reason, my arm has been going numb periodically over the past couple of days.  When I start to get the sensation I stretch out and it goes away.  I'm thinking that the way I sit at home is not conducive to my rehab.  Maybe I'll look for some good places to buy high end computer chairs for my place.

    Ugh!  I have been trying to fix a problem with my code for the past couple of months and I can't come up with a scheme that covers all the corner cases.  Super frustrating!

    I HAVE LOOSE TEA WITH COFFEE BEANS IN IT!  Sorry about that.  I couldn't hold myself back.  When I saw the Coffee Pu'erg at David's Tea, I just had to buy some.  Currently I am waiting for water to boil so that I can give it a try.

    It's that time of day again. Just about time to go home.  Today though, before I leave the office, I am gonna look for some furniture places.  I really think that my computer chair at home is causing me some shoulder issues and I'm hoping to find a good quality chair.
