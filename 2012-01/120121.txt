    Just a short update on my day so far:  It snowed outside, but the weather is warmer.  This morning I slept in but got up early enough that I didn't get a headache.  Played some Skyrim and now I just got back from taking Nicole to the school.  Now I'm going to try and set up my cgi blog system on my website.
