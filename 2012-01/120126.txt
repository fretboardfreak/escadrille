    Good morning cruel world.  Well, I guess that's not quite fair.  The world can't be that cruel if its a good morning.

    This morning whizzed right by me.  Rachel and I decided to delete code instead of adding code to fix a bug I've been working on for the past month or so.  That and I attended a training session for the career fair I get to go to next week. The training sesion was boring as expected but I am excited for the actual event.  It will be interesting to be on the other side of the table for a change.
