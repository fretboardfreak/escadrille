    Good morning fellow multi-celled organisms. It is - yet again - a Monday morning... yuk. As usual, I feel that today should really just be an extension of Sunday because the last shipment of Sunday's that I received have all seemed a bit too short.

    Perception is a tough nut to crack. Even something as inocent as admitting that you could have done something better or different can lead to people actually believing that you routinely have sub-par performance. This is simply not true. Even the most professional engineers make mistakes, find them (and admit them) and then fix them. That is our job, our "raison d'etre" -- if you will. In corporate environments - I'm beginning to learn - even if you do a great job 99% of the time and take corrective action when you don't people will misconstrue your results and misinterpret the meaning of them. This can easily lead to situations where a trusted testing tool, quickly (read: overnight) becomes distrusted and consequently disused.

    Since my job is centered around writing a testing tool, these kinds of thoughts serve as a poignant reminder that we have to make people think that Chimera is as cool and usefull as we think it is.

    I'm trying to think of a good way to use a combination of Cookie and Form input on my CGI website to provide session style interaction with the script.  I really need to break this down into multiple small modules because right now it feels like such a massively scoped problem.

    So far I think I'll need a set of classes to represent the html pages, then I'll need an session manager that will take in the Cookie and Form input.  I will also want to set up a Config file that can be shared between the different pages to create a unified interface.
