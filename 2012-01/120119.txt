    Brr. It is flipping cold outside.  It's weather like this that makes me glad my car has a block heater.

    Lately I have been working on a python 2.4 compatible CGI blog interface.  As there often is with quick projects like this there are some downfalls to using this method but the biggest is that my content files need to be compiled from rst to html before they get uploaded to the webserver.  To get around this I will write an upload script that pshould be able to compile and send the compiled content to the server.

    For now though, it is lunchtime.

    Woot, its standup meeting time.  I have filled the back of my work notebook with doodles so I have very little to do during today's meeting.
