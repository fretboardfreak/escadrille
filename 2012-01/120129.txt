    Good afternoon world.  Today I had a fairly lazy day playing video games and working on my webpage.  I feel that I can justify today's laziness because yesterday tuckered me out.

    Yesterday was the First Annual CompE Curling Funspiel and Nicoele - surprise, surprise - was the organizer.  We got to the rink early, drank beer all day, and left the rink late.  In all I'd say that pretty much everybody had fun and Nicole says they may have come out in the green too.

    The main excitement for my day though was when I bought 3 tickets for Van Halen on May 11.  This will be my first opportunity to see Van Halen live.

    Now its time for me to have a shower and relax my shoulders before curling tonight.  I really hope we win our game and break our streak of losses.

    Woot, rye at the club.  It hasn't even been 24 hours since I wast last here.  This is slightly unnatural or something.

    Mark up another win for the stodola rink in the GUSL league. Tonights win keeps us in the running for the GUSL cup for the second year in a row, and keeps me quite happy.  We played Lightbown tonight and came out comfortably on top.  Usually Lightbown is a force to be reckoned with but our whole team was playing spot on.  By putting the pressure on him we managed to even increase our spread another +7.
