Yet again, I have been shown that I am too negative, always expecting the worst.
Friday, after work, I ended up chatting with Sophia online for a bit.  Just like
every conversation I've had with her, things went great.  There was flirting
which was reciprocated and she even asked to make sure I was going to Johno's
Halfway to Halloween Party.  The conversation went so well, I even asked if she
wanted to hang out before the party for a few hours.  A bit to my surprise, she
agreed to hang out before party.  It shouldn't be too surprising that I was
ecstatic.

On Saturday, I met up with Rachel Heisler for lunch.  She's been studying for
another level of certification and taking circus classes and just keeping
herself so busy it's crazy.  The weather was great for sitting on the patio at
O'byrnes; I may have even started to get a little pink. We came up with a plan
to make Vanilla, Caramel and Bacon Iced Cream this summer because she has an
iced cream maker.  I need to make sure neither of us forget that.

Unfortunately, later on Saturday I received a message from Sophia saying that
she wouldn't be able to hang out.  She was working on material for one of her
students and it was taking longer than expected. Although I was disappointed I
could understand; it always takes me a long time to do a transcription too.

Later that night, I went to Johno's party.  I went dressed as Howie Mandel, bald
cap and everything.  Johno and Yannick were cross dressing hookers and Sophie
was their Pimp.  There were a handful of other funny costumes too.  The party
was a typical party.
