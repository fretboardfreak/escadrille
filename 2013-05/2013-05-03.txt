As usual, I meant to write a quick update a couple of different times over the
last two weeks; however, I didn't.

So I guess I'll just start from where I left off.  After Sophia and I met at the
Pourhouse we talked a few times, either with SMS or Facebook messages.  From the
nature of the conversations that we've had I would say that I haven't been given
any negative vibes.  In fact, she has stated that she'd like to hang out again.
But with all that said, we haven't set a date for any second dates and I feel
awkward being the one to always initiate the conversation.

After their show - that first night where I met Sophia - she was the one that
contacted me on Facebook.  She started it.  Following that though I asked her
out to the Pourhouse and now I'm in this weird position where I've asked her
out, she has said yes but then the conversation stopped.

Am I supposed to be clingy and possibly creepy and text her something like,
"Hey, I really like you.  Call me if you want to hang out sometime."?  I don't
know; maybe.  Looking back I guess I can say I've never really dated much
before.
