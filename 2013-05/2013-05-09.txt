continued from 2013-05-06_9:30am...  The party was a typical party for a Johno
organized costume party.  Near the end of the night I noticed Sophia leaving but
I didn't get a chance to talk because one of the other guys at the party was
really hitting on her.  After she left, I stayed a bit longer and then took my
leave as well.  The party was starting to die down anyway.

When I got home from the party, I thought I'd be cheeky and give Sophia a rough
time for not saying goodnight to me before she left.  From later conversations I
found out that she was planning on going back to the party but decided not to
since I wasn't there. Just the thing to give me a nice glowing feeling inside.
