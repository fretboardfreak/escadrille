It's that day again.  The beginning of the week; the first of 5 straight work
days.  Ugh.  However, my weekend was not too bad.

On Friday, after work, we were sitting at Rosies having a beer and I received an
email on my phone.  It was Long & Mcquade telling me my Ditto Looper had finally
come in.  So, I left Rosies early to pick up the pedal before they L&M closed.
Then I went straight home and started to play, and continued to play until
around 3 in the morning.

Over the course of the whole weekend I would say that I played about 20h of
guitar in total.  None of that guitar playing was preparation for my lesson with
Jordan this week so I'm going to have to do that after work before Thursday.
