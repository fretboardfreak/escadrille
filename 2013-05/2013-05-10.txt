TGIF.  Boy do I need a weekend.  I guess I should continue my Sophia story and
get that all out and told up to date...

While we were talking after the costume party I asked again about having dinner
together and we settled on Thursday (yesterday).  I was pretty excited and
nervous about yesterday for the rest of the week.  I had everything ready to
go; the meal was going to be lamb chops, roast greek potatos, greek salad and
asparagus.

Then at about 3 in the afternoon on Thursday I received a text message.  I'm
paraphrasing but it was something like, "I feel pretty sick today I'm going to
have to cancel".   Well that's just lovely.

I guess I made some boneheaded attempts to be the nice guy.  I said I could
bring her soup instead if she wanted to do that but that message was ignored.

Honestly, I should have left it at that.  I should have left it up to her to
talk to me again.  I'm too stupid for that though; being the idiot that I am,
I cooked that whole dinner for myself, took a picture and sent it to her.

Now I fear I'm just that crazy, stalker guy; the one that is too thick to get
the hint that he isn't wanted.  I'm the guy that keeps talking even though
everybody in the room can't stop thinking, "shut-up, shut-up, shut-up..."

It might be best for me now if I didn't initiate contact with Sophia.  If I'm
wrong about this and she does want to see me then I hope she'll text me.  :(
