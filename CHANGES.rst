Escadrille Change Log
=====================

- 0.1: 170207

  - Achieve functional unity with old, fragile website automation.
  - Rename project to "Escadrille" meaning "small squadron" in French. This
    is required because PyPI already has a package called squadron, so I need
    to find something which hasn't already been used in order to upload my
    releases to PyPI and make them publically available.
  - Configure project to use setuptools.
