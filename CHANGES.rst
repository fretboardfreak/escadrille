===================
Squadron Change Log
===================

- 0.1: *Release Date TBD*

  - Achieve functional unity with old, fragile website automation.
  - Remaining Goals:

    - Configure project to use setuptools.
    - Rename project to "Escadrille" meaning "small squadron" in French. This
      is required because PyPI already has a package called squadron, so I need
      to find something which hasn't already been used in order to upload my
      releases to PyPI and make them publically available.
