It is warm in the building today.  They had the HVAC system off in the building for the weekend.  Jane Lewchuck was back in town for a few days to take care of the project.  The shut down 2 lanes of traffic on Calgary trail so they could crane the old system off of the roof and put the new system up.  Jane emailed a bunch of pictures out.

On Friday they will be shutting down the HVAC system for replacement, which means the building will get very warm. Luckily I checked that I could still log in via the vpn page at work.  Well, I couldn't log in so I had to sit on the phone for 25 minutes while they reset it for me.

I find it difficult to determine what to write in this blog sometimes. I guess I haven't yet found the purpose or audience for this yet.  One of the main things that I have trouble with is deciding whether this blog will be public or private.

I'm leaning towards mostly private with some exceptions.  By that I mean that I plan on configuring the scripts that build a website out of this blog and my webserver that hosts the blog such that most of the content is private.  I would like to be able to somehow just tag a portion of a document or files in a directory to be public.

One idea for this that I've had is a file purpose file indicator.  It would have default actions for the case where a directory doesn't have special configuration but then, with a simple text file in the directory, one could change the use of the file.  For example given the directory ``foobar`` with the files ``private.txt``, ``public.txt``, ``somepic.png``, ``random.pdf``, one could add a file -- lets call it "filePurpose.txt" for now that marks some files as private vs public or as a file for download or even to ignore the file.

Now, to be perfectly honest, I have a long way to go before I can implement something like that but it's good to start brainstorming.
